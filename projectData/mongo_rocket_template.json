    "description": "Developed an extensible template for a backend server that is meant to interact with users. This was done in Rocket (Rust) for a memory safe, fast, and reliable backend that interacts with a Mongo database using JWT's for further security and interoperability. This is all wrapped in a docker file which cleanly makes a minimzed docker image of the backend executable and uses the standard mongo docker image for a backend that is easy to spin up and test."
