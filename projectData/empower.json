Oversaw the development of many Next.js user-focused pages and implementations such as the pathway, a way for a participant in the Empower project to have directed tasks by a guide to help them progress. In addition to this, designed and implemented many API endpoints and MongoDB logic, along with aiding in the GCP hosting. Led a team of 2 developers and helped onboard and direct them on tasks that should be done."
